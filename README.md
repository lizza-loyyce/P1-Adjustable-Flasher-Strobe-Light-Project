# Adjustable LED Flasher Using a 555 Timer

This project demonstrates a simple adjustable LED flasher circuit built using the classic 555 Timer IC in astable mode. The circuit produces a continuous blinking effect on an LED, and the flashing speed can be controlled using a potentiometer. This project was designed, wired, and simulated using Tinkercad Circuits, with both schematic and breadboard views included.

## Features
- Adjustable LED blinking speed  
- Simple 555 timer astable circuit  
- Fully simulated in Tinkercad  
- Beginner-friendly circuit design  
- Includes schematic and breadboard layout images

## How It Works
The 555 timer generates a repeated on–off signal by charging and discharging a timing capacitor through a resistor–potentiometer network. Adjusting the potentiometer varies the timing cycle, causing the LED to blink faster or slower.

## Applications
Circuits like this are commonly used in:
- Indicators and warning lights  
- Strobe and flasher systems  
- Bicycle lights  
- Turn signals  
- LED effects in toys and small devices
